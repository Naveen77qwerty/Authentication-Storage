# 🔐 Secure Password Manager

A command-line based password manager written in Python that allows you to **store**, **generate**, **update**, **view**, and **delete** encrypted passwords securely using hashing and encryption techniques.

---

## 📌 Features

* **Secure Main Password Authentication** with bcrypt
* **Password Encryption & Decryption** using Fernet (AES symmetric encryption)
* **Password Strength Validation** before storing
* **Random Strong Password Generator**
* **Data Storage in JSON** for portability and simplicity
* **Reset All Data** feature for quick recovery
* **User-friendly CLI Menu System**

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

* Python 3
* `bcrypt` – for hashing passwords
* `cryptography.fernet` – for symmetric encryption/decryption
* `json` – for local storage
* `shlex`, `random`, `string` – for secure and flexible inputs

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 📦 Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/secure-password-manager.git
cd secure-password-manager
```

2. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
pip install bcrypt cryptography
```

---

## 🧪 How to Use

### 🌟 First-Time Setup

Run the script:

```bash
python password_manager.py
```

You will be prompted to set a main password. This acts as a gatekeeper to your stored passwords.

---

### 📋 Features Overview

* **Add Account**

  * Choose to set your own password or generate a secure one.
* **Update Password**

  * Replace an existing password with a new or generated one.
* **Show Password**

  * View the decrypted password for a specific account.
* **Delete Account**

  * Permanently remove an account entry.
* **Reset All Data**

  * If you forget your main password, reset all data and start over.

---

## 🔐 Security Measures

* Passwords are **hashed with salt** using `bcrypt` – very resistant to brute-force attacks.
* Encrypted passwords are **stored** using `Fernet`, ensuring confidentiality.
* Data is stored locally in `data.json` – no external or online storage.
* **Master password** secures all actions, ensuring an additional layer of security.

```

---

## ❗Important Notes

* Do not share your `secret.key` or `main_password.json`.
* If `secret.key` is lost or altered, all encrypted passwords become unrecoverable.
* Use the **reset feature** if you forget your main password, but note: **this will erase all data.**
